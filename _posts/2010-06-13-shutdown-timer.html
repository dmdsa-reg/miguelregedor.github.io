title: Shutdown Timer
---

This is a simple tip. Go to the terminal and type:

<code>sudo shutdown -h +45</code>

After that your system will shut down in 45 minutes.
You can also specify the exact time:

<code>sudo shutdown -h 22:30</code>

If you want to cancel the shutdown timer you should use the flag "-c":

<code>sudo shutdown -c</code>

You can also use the flag "-r" or "-s", to reboot or make the system sleep. 
Read <code>man shutdown</code> for further documentation.
