title: My friends twitter updates on Google Reader
---

I was trying to get this working, but Twitter RSS feeds now require authentication, and Google Reader does not support authentication. 
A service called http://freemyfeed.com can strip away the authentication from the feed, and gives you a new RSS feed that you can then supply to Google Reader or IGoogle.
