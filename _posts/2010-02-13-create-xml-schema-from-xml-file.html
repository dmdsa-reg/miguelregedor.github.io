title: Create XML schema from XML file
---

Suppose you want to create a xsd based on an "example.xml" structure.
After download and extract <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/downloads/detail?name=trang-20090818.zip">trang</a> you can run it with:


<code>java -jar /trang.jar example.xml example.xsd</code>

The "example.xsd" file generated may not be exactly what you need, but most of the time it is a good starting point.

To validate a xml file, for instance "example.xml", against an xsd file,
"example.xsd", you can use the following command:

<code>xmllint --schema form.xsd ~/form.xml</code>
