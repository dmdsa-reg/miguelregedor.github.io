title: Analysing and Measuring Open Source Projects
---

Thousands of open source software projects are available for collaboration in platforms like Github or Sourceforge.
However, there is no systematic information about the quality of those projects.

Few users have the ability to assess the quality of a project by looking at source code. 
With that in mind, a system capable of automatically analysing and producing reports about a given Open Source Sofware Project would enable users to make better choices,
and developers to further improve their software. 

Furthermore, I am, currently, writing my master thesis and will engage myself to create an application capable of automatic analyse and measure GitHub public projects.
